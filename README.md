<div align="center"> <h1> AtomMind: Small Scientific Language Model (SsLM) </h1>

**AtomMind** is a modular, domain-specialized **Small Language Model** designed to perform reasoning, and computation across **Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**. 

*Unlike general-purpose LLMs, AtomMind just focuses on deep logical reasoning, symbolic computation, and cross-domain scientific problem-solving. Therefore it's lighter, dont cost much and more effective*

## Features

- **Domain Expertise:** Separate Domain Expert Networks (DENs) for Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.  
- **Cross-Domain Reasoning:** General Knowledge Backbone (GKB) integrates knowledge across fields.  
- **Symbolic Computation:** Symbolic Reasoning Module (SRM) handles equations, chemical graphs, and biological structures.  
- **Adaptive Learning:** Optimization & Algorithmic Module (OAM) supports meta-learning and reinforcement-guided optimization.  
- **Memory System (Optional):** Episodic and long-term memory using FAISS or Milvus for efficient knowledge storage and controlled forgetting.  
- **Self-Monitoring:** Tracks reasoning performance, accuracy, and contradictions for continual improvement.

## Architecture

- **Domain Expert Networks (DENs):** 30–40 layers per domain, hidden size 512–1024, attention heads 8–16.  
- **General Knowledge Backbone (GKB):** 20–30 layers, integrates DEN outputs for cross-domain problem-solving.  
- **Symbolic Reasoning Module (SRM):** 10–20 layers, can include GNN layers for structured data reasoning.  
- **Optimization & Algorithmic Module (OAM):** Implements meta-learning, RL-guided optimization, and algorithmic adaptation.

## Training & Learning

- **Data Source:** Curated scientific datasets (JSON/JSONL) from OpenRouter.  
- **Multi-Stage Training:**  
  1. Pretraining on structured scientific data  
  2. Domain specialization for each DEN  
  3. Integration with GKB + SRM  
  4. Optional meta-learning guided by OpenRouter  
- **Optimization:** AdamW, AdaFactor, LAMB; mixed precision and gradient clipping  
- **Curriculum Learning:** Tasks start simple and progressively increase in complexity

## Multi-Agent Integration

**Multi-agent Meta-controller**, orchestrating training, evaluation, and dataset generation. Key agent roles:

- **Planner:** Task decomposition and dataset selection  
- **Executor:** Knowledge generation and test creation  
- **Critic:** Evaluates outputs for correctness and consistency  
- **Trainer / Data Curator:** Formats and weights training data  
- **Memory Agent:** Stores reasoning traces, logs, and knowledge  

**Self-Learning Loop:** It will identifies weak domains, generates stress-test tasks, and orchestrates retraining for continual improvement.

## Infrastructure

- **Framework:** PyTorch / PyTorch Lightning  
- **Tokenizer:** GPT-2 or custom scientific tokenizer  
- **Hardware:** Multi-GPU / TPU support  
- **Optional Memory Systems:** FAISS / Milvus for embeddings and knowledge management  
- **Monitoring:** Logs accuracy, reasoning performance, contradictions, and reward scores
